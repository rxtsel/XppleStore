My first website :smiley_cat:


This is my first web pg developed before taking web development courses.
I applied knowledge that I was obtaining while reading books in pdf and looking for information in google.
From here I will continue educating myself to be better every day.
I like everything related to technology, art, and everything that takes my mind to another level.
I am a very curious person; If something interests me, I look for any way to learn about it. I consider myself self-taught.
